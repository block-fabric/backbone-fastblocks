/**
 * The fee split of FastBlocks from PosParams::fee_split_height on (doc/fastblocks.md, "Fees, the pot and
 * the validator pool"). Consensus, integers only.
 *
 *  - The fees of a peg transaction (one with a withdrawal output or a refund request: IsPegTx) go to the
 *    BMM bidder whole: into the pot for a block of stake (paid to the ticket's payee), kept by the
 *    merged miner of a BMM block.
 *  - The ordinary fees F are split: the bidder takes B = max(floor(F / 10), min(floor(F / 2), floor(30 F / S)))
 *    -- b = max(10 %, 50 % · min(1, 60 s / S)) rounded down to the satoshi -- and the validators the rest,
 *    F - B (the odd satoshi of a 50/50 split is theirs), into the validator pool.
 *  - S is the median spacing of the last 11 mainchain blocks (MedianSpacingAt) at a mainchain height the
 *    block cannot choose: the epoch's seed block for a block of stake (SeedHeight), the block before
 *    the commitment for a BMM block (PegStep::main_height). Neither depends on acknowledgements.
