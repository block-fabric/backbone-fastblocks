# Sidechains of Backbone on eCash

A sidechain made from this template runs on two families of networks:

- the **Chains** (CHN) networks, `main`, `test`, `signet`, `regtest`, sidechains of chainsd, as before;
- the **Backbone** networks on eCash (ECX), `-chain=ecash`, `ecashbeta`, `ecashtest`: sidechains of
  backboned on eCash's main network, its betanet and its test network (backboned's own `-chain` names).

The rules of a sidechain are the same on both. What differs is the mainchain: Backbone on eCash follows the
drivechain rules of the bip300301_enforcer (votes counted per period; a bundle is paid with more than 13,150
votes in 26,300 blocks, more than 5 in 10 on the test network and the eCash regtest), has ten-minute blocks,
uses `OP_NOP8` as `OP_DRIVECHAIN` and, above all, **does not pay one bundle per slot** (see below).

## Networks

| `-chain=` | Mainchain (backboned) | RPC / P2P (template; a sidechain: 8x54/8x55...) | Mainchain RPC (default) | Data directory | Address prefix (template) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ecash` | `-chain=ecash` | 8654 / 8655 | 8532 | `~/.backbone-<name>` (Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Backbone-<Name>`, macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Backbone-<Name>`), at its root | `esc` |
| `ecashbeta` | `-chain=ecashbeta` | 38654 / 38655 | 8532 | the same, `betanet/` | `besc` |
| `ecashtest` | `-chain=ecashtest` | 48654 / 48655 | 48532 | the same, `testnet4/` | `tesc` |
| `main`, `test`, `signet`, `regtest` | chainsd | 9654... (unchanged) | 9554, 19554, 39554, 29554 | `~/.<name>` (unchanged) | `sc`, `tsc`, `rsc` |

- **Ports.** A sidechain's eCash ports are those of its Chains main network less 1000 (8x54 RPC, 8x55 P2P),
  betanet's 30,000 above them (38x54), the test network's 40,000 above (48x54, beside Backbone's 48532).
- **The mainchain node.** The cookie is looked for in Backbone's data directory (`~/.backbone`, and its
  `betanet/`, `testnet4/`) for the eCash networks, in Chains' for the others; `-mainchaindatadir`,
  `-mainchainrpcport` and `-mainchainrpccookiefile` as before. The network check of the link reads
  `getblockchaininfo`'s `network` (Backbone's name: `ecash`, `ecashbeta`, `ecashtest`; its `chain` is eCash's
  `main`/`testnet4`), else its `chain` (chainsd). A sidechain on regtest follows either a Chains regtest node or
  backboned `-regtest -testecash` (with `-testmainenforcer`, below).
- **Identity.** Each eCash network has a genesis block of its own (its own message), message start, ports and
  address prefix (`CEcashSidechainParams`, `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`; the TODO there says what a new
  sidechain sets). The rules are those of the sidechain's main network (its test network's for `ecashtest`).
- The app's supervisor of sidechain nodes passes `-chain=ecash|ecashbeta|ecashtest` for a mainchain on those
  networks (`webui/sidechainnodes.cpp`). The app's own network list (`chain.json`) has the Chains networks only
  so far (follow-up).

## Without single payout: rules from the enforcer's events

The Chains mainchain fails a slot's other pending bundles when it pays one, and never lets a paid bundle be
proposed again. The enforcer does neither, until it adopts our safety rules at a height
(`getdrivechaininfo`'s `singlepayout`, Backbone's `safety_activation_height`). On the eCash networks the
sidechain's peg rules take only what the enforcer reports per block (`SidechainParams::main_events_only`), so
that a node can follow an eCash node and the enforcer through its interface alone (`-mainchaingrpc`):
no scores, no hold for another branch's bundle, this chain's bundle kept until the mainchain closes it, a
foreign payout matched outside it first, and bundles handed to an enforcer only once their commitment is a day
deep. Everything, with the safety argument: `doc/ecash-enforcer.md`.

- `getwithdrawalbundle` never says `held` on the eCash networks.
- **Votes.** Over JSON-RPC the sidechain node tells Backbone to upvote its bundle and downvote every other one of
  the slot (`vouchwithdrawalbundle`); Backbone's block template never votes for, proposes or pays a bundle that was
  paid, or pending at a payout of its slot, and does not broadcast its withdrawal (`sendwithdrawalbundle`). Through
  the enforcer alone there is no vouching: its block producer upvotes the bundles handed to it.
- The warning "paid a withdrawal bundle of this sidechain and left another one pending" is said only where the
  mainchain is meant to pay one bundle per slot.

What remains: a majority of eCash's hashrate can still pay a bundle twice (a paid bundle proposed again, or a
leftover one), against the votes of the miners who run the sidechain; the sidechain then matches the payout to
withdrawals as far as it can, and the escrow pays the difference. That is the enforcer's rule until it adopts
single payout and paid-bundle memory.

## Parameters tied to the mainchain's blocks

The mainchain's blocks are ten minutes on eCash against one on Chains; one block of the sidechain per mainchain
block. Per network (`Consensus::SidechainParams`, `nPowTargetSpacing`):

| Parameter | What | Chains main (test) | eCash `ecash`, `ecashbeta` | `ecashtest` | regtest `-testmainenforcer` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pending_min_score` | score with which a foreign bundle holds refunds back: a tenth of the payout threshold (not used where `main_events_only`) | 6480 (30) | 1315 (of 13,150), unused | 2 (of 5), unused | 2 (of 5), unused |
| `bundle_retry_delay` | sidechain blocks after a failed bundle before the next | 144 = 2.4 h (20) | 15 = 2.5 h | 3 = 0.5 h | 5 |
| `unproposed_expiry_blocks` | mainchain blocks in which the mainchain must propose a committed bundle (not used where `main_events_only`) | 1440 = 1 day (60) | unused | unused | unused |
| `main_events_only` | the rules take only the enforcer's events (`doc/ecash-enforcer.md`) | false | true | true | true |
| `bundle_handoff_depth` (policy) | mainchain blocks deep a bundle's commitment is before it is handed to an enforcer (`-mainchaingrpc`) | (6, unused) | 144 = 1 day | 12 = 2 h | 2 |
| `main_single_payout` | the mainchain pays one bundle per slot | true | false | false | false |
| `refund_grace_blocks` (policy) | blocks in which a new withdrawal can still be refunded ahead of a bundle | 6 | 1 | 1 | 6 |
| `main_behind_margin` (policy) | mainchain blocks behind its headers before the link is "syncing" | 6 | 2 | 2 | 6 |
| `nPowTargetSpacing` | the sidechain's block interval: stale-tip and block download timers, the app's estimates | 60 s | 600 s | 600 s | 600 s |
| `PENDING_TREND_BLOCKS`/`MIN_RISE` | a rising foreign leader: 3 net upvotes in 12 mainchain blocks | 12/3 | 12/3 (same ratio: 13,150 in 26,300 is half a vote per block, as 64,800 in 129,600) | 12/3 | 12/3 |

Unchanged, as they count no time: BMM requests are good for the next mainchain block only (both mainchains);
deposits are paid by the first sidechain block after the mainchain block that has them (no maturity:
`coinbase_maturity` 0); withdrawal bundles live as the mainchain says (`bundle_max_age` 26,300 blocks, half a year,
on eCash; payment after more than 13,150 votes, at least about 91 days); the follower polls every second.

The parameter fingerprint of the drivechain database changes only where `main_single_payout` is false.

## Slots on eCash

LayerTwo Labs' sidechains on eCash (`LayerTwo-Labs/drivechain-frontends`, `sidechain_core/lib/config/sidechains.dart`,
read 2026-10-20): BBC 1, BitNames 2, BitAssets 4, Thunder 9, Truthcoin 13, Liquid signet 24, zSide 98, Photon 99,
FreeBank 130, CoinShift 255. Ours on Chains collide at 2 (Thunder), 4 (BitAssets) and 9 (Hivemind). Betanet's
list of active sidechains could not be read from public data here (no betanet node with its blocks on this
machine, and no public page found that lists betanet's slots); check it with `listactivesidechains` on a synced backboned
`-chain=ecashbeta` before proposing.

Proposed map, a block of our own away from LayerTwo's (so that their next sidechains, at low numbers, do not
collide either):

| Sidechain | Chains slot | eCash slot |
|---|---|---|
| Thunder | 2 | **40** |
| BitNames | 3 | **41** |
| BitAssets | 4 | **42** |
| zSide | 6 | **43** |
| Hivemind | 9 | **44** |
| FastBlocks | 5 | **45** |
| Layers | 7 | **46** |
| template | 0 | 0 (placeholder) |

The same slot on `ecash`, `ecashbeta` and `ecashtest`. A slot is taken by proposing (M1) and acking (M2) it:
on eCash's main network more than 1,815 acks in 2,016 blocks (provisional, the BIP300 specification's), on
betanet more than 1,008 in 2,016: a two-week commitment of a hashrate majority.

## Tests

- `src/test/drivechain_tests.cpp` `without_main_single_payout_a_supported_bundle_holds_new_ones_back` (the rules
  with scores, kept for a mainchain without single payout that reports them) and the `events_only_*` tests (the
  rules of the eCash networks, `doc/ecash-enforcer.md`).
- `src/test/sidechain_mainclient_tests.cpp` `ecash_networks`: names, ports, folders, data directory, identities
  (no two networks alike), the per-network parameters, the network check of the link.
- `test/functional/feature_sidechain_ecash.py`: against backboned `-regtest -testecash` (`MAINCHAIN_BIN_DIR`,
  default `../chains-ecash/build_node/bin`): proposal and acks to activation, the OP_NOP8 treasury, BMM, a deposit,
  a withdrawal bundle voted and paid (M3, M4, M6), a bundle failing at its maximum age and its withdrawal
  refunded, and a leftover bundle of another branch holding nothing back, the new one paid and the other
  failed, the withdrawal paid once. `feature_sidechain_enforcer.py`: the same through the enforcer's interface
  alone (`-mainchaingrpc`), with reorgs.

## FastBlocks

FastBlocks on eCash: slot **45** on `ecash`, `ecashbeta` and `ecashtest`; RPC/P2P ports 8154/8155, 38154/38155,
48154/48155; message starts `66626c21`, `66626c22`, `66626c23`; address prefixes `fblx`, `bfblx`, `tfblx`; data in
`~/.backbone-fastblocks`. Its rules are those of its main network (`ecashtest`: of its test network), its blocks of
stake every 15-second slot; what counts its anchors (one per mainchain block: ten minutes on eCash, one on Chains)
is scaled as Layers' (`Consensus::PosParams`, `CEcashSidechainParams`):

| Parameter | What | Chains main | eCash `ecash`, `ecashbeta` | `ecashtest` (Chains test) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fee_target_spacing` (new) | the mainchain spacing the fee curves are drawn for: S taken as 60 × S / target, so 50/50 at the target and below, the second curve 5 points less per target above it, 20 % from 7 × target | 60 s | 600 s | 600 s (60) |
| `max_unanchored_slots` | blocks of stake halt this many slots after the first one no anchor covers | 240 (1 h) | 1920 (8 h: a gap of the mainchain of 6 h with room) | 1920 (240) |
| `stall_seconds` | BMM blocks carry transactions after so long without blocks of stake, by the mainchain's median time (which lags the clock about 50 min on eCash, 5 on Chains) | 1800 | 3600 | 3600 (600) |
| `seed_lookahead_seconds` | the leader seed of an epoch: the highest mainchain block at least so long (median time) before it; an epoch has a leader once the record has a block with a later median time | 1200 (20 blocks) | 32400 (9 h: epochs seeded through a 6 h gap, the median time ~50 min behind) | 32400 (600) |
| `set_lead_seconds` (new) | the validator set of an epoch: the newest anchor before the epoch before it and at least so long before it starts (`pos::SetBoundary`): fixed before its seed's block can exist | 0 (an epoch) | 32400 (as the seed) | 32400 (0) |
| `unbonding_anchors` | unbonded coins are paid so many anchors later | 2880 (2 days) | 1008 (7 days) | 144 (1 day; 120: 2 hours) |
| `evidence_window_anchors` (slashing) | a double-signing proof is valid this many anchors after its epoch's set | 1440 (1 day) | 1007 (until the stake is paid back) | 143 (60: 1 hour) |
| `pot_reserve_anchors` | each anchor pays 1/this of the pot's reserve | 1440 | 144 | 6 (60) |
| `final_anchors` (not consensus) | wallets call a block final under so many anchors | 6 (6 min) | 3 (30 min) | 3 (3) |
| `slot_seconds`, `slots_per_epoch` | blocks of stake | 15, 240 | 15, 240 | 15, 40 |
| `nPowTargetSpacing` | Bitcoin's heuristics: a block a slot | 15 s | 15 s | 15 s |
| `refund_grace_blocks`, `bundle_retry_delay` | in blocks of this chain (blocks of stake), as on Chains | as on Chains | as on Chains main | as on Chains test |

The peg rules are those of the eCash networks (`doc/ecash-enforcer.md`: from the enforcer's events alone). Regtest
`-testmainenforcer` adds `fee_target_spacing` 600. Tests: `test/functional/feature_fastblocks_ecash.py` (three
validators against backboned `-regtest -testecash`: activation, the OP_NOP8 treasury, a deposit, blocks of stake,
anchors 40 slots apart, a withdrawal bundled, voted and paid out, the peg balance) and
`feature_fastblocks_enforcer.py` (the same through the enforcer's interface alone, `-mainchaingrpc`, no JSON-RPC).

### A gap of the mainchain

Blocks of stake go on through a gap of the mainchain (no eCash block, so no anchor and no new seed) of up to six
hours with room (user requirement, 2026-10-21). Three limits bound how long, from the last eCash block t0:

- **The seed.** An epoch has a leader once the mainchain record has a block whose median time is later than its start
  less `seed_lookahead_seconds` (`pos::SeedHeight`). In a gap the median time stops about 50 minutes before t0
  (eCash's median of 11 blocks), so epochs starting up to t0 + 9 h − 50 min − an epoch (about t0 + 7 h) are led. With
  the earlier hour, blocks of stake stopped 10 to 70 minutes into a gap, long before `max_unanchored_slots`.
- **The anchors.** The first block of stake no anchor covers is about one eCash block before t0 (the last ticket
  anchors the chain up to there); blocks of stake go on 8 hours after it. When eCash comes back, its first block
  commits to the ticket made before the gap, which is acknowledged if still within the 8 hours (a gap of up to about
  7 h 40 min), the next to a ticket of the newest block: the blocks of the gap are anchored, then final (3 anchors).
  The work of an anchor is a walk over the run it covers (at most 1920 blocks), as before.
- **The set.** With the seed 9 hours ahead, the set an anchor an epoch before made (the Chains rule) would be fixed
  after the seed's block exists: a validator could pick a key or a stake for a known seed. `set_lead_seconds` (9 h)
  fixes it before: an anchor whose slot, and whose commitment's median time, are before the seed's time, so the
  seed's block is at or above the block that committed the anchor (only the mainchain's miner can bias a seed, as
  before). Bonds, unbonds and jails therefore take effect about ten hours later than they are mined; during a gap
  every epoch's set is the last anchor's before it.

What a gap does not stall: `stall_seconds` (BMM blocks take transactions when blocks of stake stop) compares the
mainchain's median time with the last block of stake, which a gap leaves fresh; the fee split's spacing S (a median of
11 spacings) takes a gap as one long spacing; the mainchain link (`main_behind_margin`, IBD) sees a quiet mainchain,
not a lagging one; unbonding and the reserve's payouts count anchors, so they pause. The leader schedule is known
about 8 hours ahead (an hour before). In the app, the Finality card says when no eCash block came for half an hour:
the new blocks stay soft until one anchors them, and how long blocks of stake go on.

**Unbonding and proofs.** A week of anchors (1008; a day, 144, on `ecashtest`, which must outlast the set lead), and
a proof of double signing is taken until the stake it slashes is paid back: an unbond of a set's stake is mined at
that set's anchor or later, so its coins stay at least until that anchor's count plus `unbonding_anchors`; the window
is one less (1007, 143). Both are far past the ~60 anchors a validator still leads after it unbonds (the set lead and
two epochs). `pot_reserve_anchors` only smooths the payouts of penalties (unchanged).

Regtest scales these with `-testposparam=name@value` (`max_unanchored_slots`, `slots_per_epoch`, `set_lead_seconds`,
`unbonding_anchors`, `evidence_window_anchors`, `pot_reserve_anchors`, `stall_seconds`) and `-posseedlookahead`;
`test/functional/feature_fastblocks_ecash_gap.py` runs a gap of six hours' worth (a mainchain block every 4 s for ten
minutes: 144 s), the anchors' catch-up, finality, a week of unbonding (80 anchors) and a proof one anchor before its
window closes. `getposinfo` says `maxunanchoredslots`, `setleadseconds`, `seedlookaheadseconds`.

Regtest `-testmainenforcer` adds `fee_target_spacing` 600 to the template's (the PoS test values are regtest's).
`getposinfo`'s and `getstakinginfo`'s `feesplit` say `targetspacing`, and `spacing` as the curves take it.
Test: `test/functional/feature_layers_ecash.py` (three validators against backboned `-regtest -testecash`:
activation, the OP_NOP8 treasury, a deposit, blocks of stake, anchors, anchors 40 slots apart with blocks of
stake going on between them, a withdrawal from a block of stake bundled, voted and paid out, the peg balance);
`test/functional/feature_layers_enforcer.py`: the same three validators following the mainchain through the
enforcer's interface alone (`-mainchaingrpc`, no JSON-RPC: `doc/ecash-enforcer.md`), the anchors' tickets
through `CreateBmmCriticalDataTransaction`, the bundle handed over at depth 2 and paid.
